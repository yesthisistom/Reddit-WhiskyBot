dcwhisky's whiskybot

This bot has two main python files.  

The first scans all comments added to /r/dcwhisky for references to itself, and adds or removes users from its database per their request. 

The second performs weekly posts of two types; review and whiskyporn roundup, and /r/scotchswap posts, but successful swaps and ISO/FT threads.
